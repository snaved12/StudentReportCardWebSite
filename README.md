Project Title: Student Record Management System

Project Description:
The Student Record Management System is a web-based application designed for educational institutions, such as schools or colleges, to efficiently manage student information and generate academic reports. This system streamlines the process of recording and maintaining student data, updating records, and producing report cards in a digital format.

Key Features:

Student Information Management:

Add, update, and delete student records.
Store details such as roll number, name, and a list of subjects along with their marks and grades.
Report Generation:

Generate report cards for individual students.
Create reports in PDF format based on predefined templates (e.g., ProgressReport.jrxml).
Include student name, roll number, and detailed subject-wise marks and grades in the reports.
Bulk Data Import:

Import student data in bulk using JSON format.
Parse and save student records, which can be particularly useful during the start of a school year or semester.
Data Export:

Export student data as a ZIP archive of report cards in PDF format.
The application can generate reports for all students, providing a convenient way to download and distribute report cards.
Search and Retrieval:

Search for specific students using their roll numbers.
View individual student records and reports on demand.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and provide informative error messages to users.
User Interface:

Create a user-friendly web interface with visually appealing design elements.
Use Thymeleaf as the template engine for rendering dynamic content.
Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Java
Web Framework: Spring Boot
Database: The database system is not explicitly mentioned, but it's expected to be used for data storage.
Front-End: HTML, CSS
Report Generation: JasperReports
Data Serialization: JSON (for bulk data import)
Version Control: The code might be managed with a version control system like Git.
Additional Considerations:

Security: Ensure appropriate security measures to protect student data and user authentication/authorization if needed.
Data Validation: Implement validation for user inputs to maintain data integrity.
Error Handling: Provide error handling and a user-friendly error page for any unexpected issues.
Future Enhancements:

For future development, you may consider adding features like user roles and access control, exporting data to different formats, or integrating with other educational management systems.
